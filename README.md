# Boilerplate Go API

This is a simple boilerplate application in Go for a HTTP API.
It comes with a logger, custom context and some helpers.

## How To

To use this boilerplate simply:
1. Clone the repo
2. Delete the `.git` folder to get a fresh start
3. Delete `go.mod` and `go.sum` followed by `go mod init {your-new-app-name}`
4. Rename `on-air` with the name of your app
5. Make any required changes to the configs, Makefile and Docker files

## Contribute

This is intended to be used as a quick way to standup an API service in Go. Feel free to PR any suggestions or improvements that you think might be helpful for a future service ðŸ’ª
